# Catmull_Rom_Curve
Some notes on Catmull-Rom Curve
* We only consider centripetal Catmull-Rom cubic curve
* The curve is first-order differentiable and has **no** self-intersection
* Please refer to this [paper](http://www.cemyuksel.com/research/catmullrom_param/catmullrom.pdf) for more details
* In this repository, we would follow the paper and 
1.  Derive the curve in Beizer curve form
2.  Give a sample on how to construct in Swift
